# Boilerplate
#### HTML files use a .html file extention
#### The homepage of a webpage should always be named index.html because most browsers look for index.html by default.
# Doctype
#### The very first line should be the doctype, which tells the version of html being used
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
####
# HTML element
#### the entire HTML doc is enlclosed in a HTML tag 
```
<html>
content
</html>
```
#### Attributes can also be added to the elments, which provide addtional information about the element. example: 
```
<html lang = "en">
content
</html>
```
#### Here, the 'lang' attributes tells us that the attribute is in english
# Head Element
#### Head element is used to store important information about the webpage. Things to be displayed on the webpage should not be included in the head element
## Meta element
#### Meta element should be included in the head element with the charset attribute to make sure all symbols are read and displayed correctly
## Title Element
#### Title element determines the name displayed on the browser. by default its the file name.
# Body Element
#### This is where all the content such as text, links, images etc of the webpage are displayed
